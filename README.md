## About The Project
In this project a molecular dynamic simulation of fluid Argon in reduced units is done in the "C"-programming language. As a interaction potential between the atom the Lennard-Jones Potential is chosen, the dynamics however are calculated with Newtonian mechanics. Therefore we consider a semi-classical system of atoms.
